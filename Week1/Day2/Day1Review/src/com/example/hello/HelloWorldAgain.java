	 * What is Java?
	 * 	OOP language, statically typed language, compiled language
	 * 
	 * 	statically typed language:
	 * 		When we assign the datatype of a variable, the datatype cannot change. i.e. int -> char
	 * 
	 * Compiled language:
	 * 		The language has to be compiled first before its run. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * JDK? 
	 * 		Java Development kit that we use to create Java code, it contains JRE and other development tools like
	 * 		the Debugger and the Compiler. 
	 * 
	 * JRE? 
	 * 		Runtime environment contains core libraries for JAva code to function and the JVM. 
	 * 
	 * JVM?
	 * 		Component of the JRE, a virtual machine to load the code and execute it on a machine. 
	 * 		Translate bytecode into machine code.
