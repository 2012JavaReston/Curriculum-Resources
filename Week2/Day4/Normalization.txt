Normalization
	Optimise the structure of the data in our database. 	
	Reduces redundancy of data and improves data integrity and consistency.

There are 6 Normal Forms. 

The industry standard is 3NF 

We want to achieve 1st Normal Form:
	We need Primary key column 
	Atomic columns (as granular as possible)
	No repeating groups 

2nd Normal Form:
	We need 1st Normal Form 
	No partial dependency 
	Every non key attribute is fully dependent on the primary key.

3rd Normal Form:
	We need 2nd Form.
	No transitive dependency. 

A good way to remember the normal forms are:
	The Key, the whole key, nothing but the key
