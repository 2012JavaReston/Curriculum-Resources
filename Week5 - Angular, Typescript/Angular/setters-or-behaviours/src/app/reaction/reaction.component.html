    <p> Inside our reaction component! {{capturedSpeechBubble}}</p>
    <p> Still inside our reaction component! 
        But this is from the parent, not the trigger {{parentValue}}</p>
    <p>
        Still inside reaction, still from parent, but not using [()]
        {{anotherValue}}
    </p>

    <p> This is the combined value of both, that does not exist in reaction or parent!

        {{reactionSpecial}}
