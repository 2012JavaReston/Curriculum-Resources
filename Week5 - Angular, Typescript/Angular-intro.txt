What is a framework?
	A framework is a comphrehensive library built to make complex coding applications easier. 
	Allows you to do VERY complex blocks of code with small lines of code. 

Framework vs Library?
	Your code will utilise library functionality to help it along. 
	A FRAMEWORK will use YOUR code like a library to finetune its functionality. 

	Inversion of Control

		Is the process of GIVINP UP CONTROL of some functionality to another ENTITY.
		Real world example: IoC would be like asking a Subway worker 
			to make your sandwich as opposed to doing it yourself at home.

		Dependency Injection(DI) design pattern
			DI is a subset of IoC
			The DI design pattern is SPECIFICALLY when the functionality you
				give up is in cnotrol of your dpendency. The other ENTITY will 
				then inject your dependencies into your classes when the need 
				arises.

What is Angular?
	Scafolding to a frontend application, in HTML, CSS and JS/TS. 
	We use this framework because cereating an applicaiton with just JS can becomem
	cumbersome when it becomes very large. 
	Angular is component based. Each PIECE of the heml page will 
		actually be a fragment referred to as a "component"
	A SPA framework. 

History of Angular!

	AngularJS came out on October 2010 (Angular JS)
	Angular 4 - March, 2017
	Angular 9 - February, 2020

	AngularJS vs Angular not JS
	Angular is JS-based one source fron-end framework. It doesn't support the features of 
	server side programming languagre, nor dynamic loading of the page. 
	AngularJS doesn't have support mobiles 
	USed a MVC architecutre to build applications vs Angular is componend based to build application. 

	Angular4+ is a complete rewrite of ANgularJS. Angular is built on component hierarchy. 
	Angular JS is based on controllers and scopes. 

SPA - Single Page Application?
	SPA is a web application that fits on a single page in the browser. 
	All the necessary code: HTML, JS and CSS is retrieved by the browser in a single load. 
	So rather than navigation on a website being achieved by using multiple 
	(Static) html page and refereshing, we will dynamically modify elements within the page. 

	Advantages: 
		Fast and responsive: SPA only update the required elements/content. 
			SO HTML, CSS and JS are only loaded once. This is signficantly
			faster than having to navigate to entire webpages. 
		Caching capabilities: SPA can cache requests locally, it can reuse the data and 
			even work offline (with the data being synchronised with the server when possible)

	Disadvantages: 
		Data is frontloaded: the first page can load a little slower 
			(but overall the performance is still better)
		Doesn't perform well with SEO Serach engine optimization. 
		SPA are less secure towards Cross-site (XSS) attacis.
