Angular Package Structure:


		package.json: It's a JSON file that exists at the root of a JS/node project.
			It holds metadata relevant to the project. Used for managing the project's 
			dependencies. 

		tsconfig.json: It's a JSON file, that configures how Typescript is transpiled into
			JavaScript. 

		tslint.json: A file that configures what standards your code should follow. 

		app.module.ts: Keeps track of all of your modules. 
				(A module is basically a piece of code)

		Webpack:
			Used to bundle JavaScript modules into a single JavaScript file(s).
			A module is just a file, one script is one module. Modules can be 
			exported and imported by other modules.
