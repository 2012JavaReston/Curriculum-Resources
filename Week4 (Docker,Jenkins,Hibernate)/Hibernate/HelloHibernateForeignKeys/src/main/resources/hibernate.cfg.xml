<!-- 

		What is Hibernate?
			Hibernate is an ORM and persistence framework. 
			
		What is an ORM?
			Object Relational Mapping. ORMs take objects in your programming language and converts them into sql rows in your database
			
		What are the benefits of Hibernate?
			As Java developers, we no longer need to write complex sql queries. Hibernate will perform lots of complexity for us. 
			>Hibernate is object oriented. 
			>Hibernate is fast
				-Connection pooling
			>Hibernate is modular

	 			A method of speeding up database calls. 
	 			Hibernate will create n connections to the database when it starts up (default is 20)
	 			Everytime a session is created, a session will "borrow" an active connection 
	 			When you close a session, the connection is freed up for another session to use.

	 		 		CREATE : drops all existing tables & other objects with names you have provided in the annotations.
	 		 					Then Hibernate will create you schema from scratch. (Not the best for production, only for Dev purposes)
	 		 		VALIDATE: Hibernate checks to make sure the schema exists as expected before operating. 
	 		 		
	 		 		UPDATE: Hibernate will not delete anything, it'll only add/modify existing schema elemetns. So the schema works with 
	 		 				the Hibenrate schema. 
	 		 		NONE: nothing
